# Discord.js Bot (but PHP)

The most repulsive repo you never wanted to see!

# Intro

I'll fill this out later.

# FAQ (or something like that)

### Wh... Why would you do such a thing?

I was bored. I needed yet another reason for people to scream at me. This seemed like it'd work well.

### Using `var`? Prepending all variables with `$`? Attaching all those functions to `global`?!?!

ITS. JOKE.

But there are reasons for each of those.

* PHP variables are declared and referenced with `$`
* PHP variables are function-scoped, just like `var`, so it only makes sense to use `var` over `let` or `const`.
* Attaching functions to `global` is bad, yes, but I couldn't think of any other way to do so. I'd never do such a thing in a real project. You got something better, huh?! (Really, if you do, feel free to create a pull request.)

### Some of those functions don't work the exact same as they are in PHP!

Trust me, I (probably) know. Some are either missing additional parameters, simply can't work the same because of some stupid JavaScript limitation, or some other miscellaneous reason. I tried my best, okay?! :(

### A few of those doc blocks don't look very accurate, or they're a bit inconsistent. Why?

You can probably blame the PHP docs for some of those. As everyone knows, PHP isn't the most consistent thing in the world. But for inaccurate function/param/return value descriptions, you can possibly

### Did you put spend time and effort into this, all for a joke?

Yes, yes I did. This is a good measurement of how far I'll go for a joke.

Did I spend too much time on this? Yes.
Was it worth risking losing

### How do I contribute to this ridiculous project?

Are you drunk? Not even _I_ want to contribute.

... But if you really want to, feel free to create a pull request - even if it's just for shits 'n giggles. As long as it looks like real PHP, anything goes.

# Examples

For the sake of taking this joke even further, I went the extra mile and made an examples folder. You can check them out by running `npm run <script>`, where `<script>` can be `arrays`, `conditionals`, `strings`, or `typecasting`.

The only ones that I didn't create examples for were the functions inside the `./functions/general_functions.php.js` file, but you can probably just look at the code/doc blocks and get a general idea of what each of them do.

# Rest in Peace to...

* Your eyes
* My eyes
* My sanity
* The friendships I once had before showing them this
